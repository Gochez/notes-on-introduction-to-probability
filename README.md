# NOTES ON INTRODUCTION TO PROBILITY
***

Welcome to the series of Jupyter notebooks on my journey through the book developed from Harvard's stats 110 lectures.


[You can find the book here](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1466575573)


Some of the things I'll be covering:
* Solutions to exercises.
* Simulations translated into Python.
* Stat110 class notes.
